JPStats is a web app that scrapes real time job posting data from [tr.indeed.com](https://tr.indeed.com) with Node JS using request-promise module and CheerioJS library, and visualizes that data with a bar chart using Chart.js, allowing user to compare the number of job postings of software development technologies in different categories.
